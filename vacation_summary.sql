Temple\'s shrines and monasteries keeping alive Buddhist traditions are everywhere.    \r\nTemple of the Sacred Tooth Relic\r\nEver since 4th Century A.D, when the Buddha\'s Tooth was brought to Sri Lanka hidden from sacrilegious hands in an Orissan princess\' hair, the Relic has grown in repute and holiness in Sri Lanka and throughout the Buddhist world. It is considered Sri Lanka\'s most prized possession. \r\nRoyal Botanical Gardens\r\n147 acres in extent: started in 1374 as a pleasure garden of the King’s of Kandy.

It was established in 1988 to protect Sri Lanka’s turtles from extinction. Since then it has released about 3.5 million baby turtles into the wild.\r\nThe hatchery pays fishermen for eggs that they collect at night along the long sandy beach. Although October to April is the main laying season, some eggs (mostly green turtles) can be found at Kosgoda throughout the year.\r\nThe hatchery buries the eggs in sand, and when they hatch around 50 days later the baby turtles are released into the sea at night. Only about one in 1,000 turtles survives to maturity.\r\nKosgoda turtle hatchery also has tanks for injured or disabled turtles, including albino turtles that would not survive in the wild\r\nProceed to Madu Ganga for a Boat Ride  \r\nThe estuary of the Madu Ganga River is a complex coastal ecosystem of mangroves and islands. It may be one of the last remaining tracts of pristine mangrove forests in Sri Lanka.\r\nA boat trip is a wonderful way of seeing some of the hundreds of species of plants and animals – monkeys eat fruit in the trees, a water monitor lizard glides slowly through The water, and cormorants, egrets and kingfishers wait patiently on the banks, eyeing the water for prey.\r\nThere are around 64 islands in the river and lagoon, from a tiny speck housing a deserted shrine to one housing 250 families connected to the mainland with a very long footbridge.\r\nYou can visit an island with a Buddhist monastery, where the friendly young monks will show you a 150-year-old book made of palm leaves and how they cook on cinnamon wood on an open fire.\r\nThe main occupations of the local inhabitants are producing cinnamon and prawn fishing – if you take the trip in the evening you will see the fishermen in their canoes lighting lanterns to attract the shellfish into their traps.\r\n\r\nEnjoy Water Sports.\r\nproceed to Colombo.\r\nLate evening Enjoy City tour in Colombo + Shopping\r\nArrive in Colombo.\r\nColombo - a drive through the city taking you to the busy commercial areas as well as the tree-lined residential, Cinnamon Gardens. \r\nVisit Fort, the former British administrative center and military garrison, Sea Street - the Goldsmith’s quarters in the heart of Pettah, the Bazaar area, where is also a Hindu Temple with elaborate stone carvings, and the Dutch Church of Wolfendhal dating back to 1749. \r\nAlso visit the BMICH, see the replica of Avukana Buddha and Independence Square.\r\nOvernight stay at Colombo Hotel.', '2025-02-20 08:31:46', 18),
